                <p>Over the years, the government has also used this day as a platform to launch various sports schemes, including the Khelo India movement, which was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2018. Sports occupies a vital role in our lives. It keeps us fit, healthy and makes us active. The secret to having a healthy and positive lifestyle to have a positive mind and body. Sports is one such activity which helps us in maintaining a proper physique and a positive mentality. Sports is such an activity that it can be taken up by anyone, at nay age and any point of life. Adults, children and elders- everyone alike can take part in sports. Many regards sports as a mere co-curricular or extra-curricular activity in schools. However, in reality sports play an equally important role as does the education. To achieve overall and all-round development in life, one should be well-versed in both sports and culture. While training sharpens the mind, sports sharpen the body and fitness. The aim of sports training is to achieve maximum individual or team efficiency in a selected sports discipline limited by rules.There are numerous advantages of involving oneself in sports. First and foremost, as known by all and very definitively, competitions increase the physical fitness of an individual. Additionally, sports also contribute to building stable mental well-being of a person. Various studies show that people who are in the daily practice of sports in any form record better mental health as well as physical health. Moreover, sports also eliminate the risk of a person catching diseases or facing any body interruptions. Competitions increase immunity and increase people’s stamina. Reaching maximum efficiency in any activity is not possible over a day. Efficiency is conditioned by several interrelated areas.

                <p>Sports also influence the sports the life expectancy of people, incraseing the potential years to live of an average human individual. All of us are associated with games somehow or the other in pur lives. Many institutions do not make it obligatory to pursue sports in higher academics, some of us are dissociated from its practice. A lot of people take up games on their own accord.

            <img src={require('../../Images/img2pro9.jpg')} /> 
            <p>Sports builds several characteristics and personality traits in a person. Sports insists a sense of confidence and enthusiasm in an individual’s attitude. People involved in regular sports practices show qualities of leadership, team work, and excellence in their personalities and behaviour. Sports makes one competitive, however in a healthy manner. It also helps us to deal with failure and enables us to work hard in achieving our respective goals.Motor abilities are manifested on the outside by sports skills. Sports skills are presuppositions needed for implementing performance in a selected sports discipline which is limited by rules. Such presuppositions are gained through motor learning. It, however, would not be possible to implement sports skills or develop locomotive abilities without motivation. Motivation is understood as an inner incentive to carry out certain activity. The final area needed for performance implementation is represented by tactical skills. Tactics means conducting a sports competition in a purposeful way.</p>
            <p>The contents of sports training consists of individual key areas which are called components of sports training:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Physical component is generally focused on developing motor abilities.</li>
                        <li>Technical component focuses on acquiring sports skills through motor learning.</li>
                        <li>Tactical component focuses on acquiring and further development of different ways to conduct sports contest on a purposeful basis.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Sports training is understood as a process of systematic development of each component in dependence on the duration of preparation which leads to achieving maximum efficiency in senior age within the selected sports discipline. Psychological component is focused on improving the athlete’s personality. Sports skills are based on contents of a specific sports discipline. In volleyball, the content of skills is for instance setting, reception, block, service etc. The aim of developing these skills is acquiring high level of automatization. These skills accompany the athlete during the whole period of his sports career regardless of the performance level he or she is at. The athlete keeps such skills for the whole of his sports career regardless of performance level. Acquiring these skills should be in compliance with long-term conception of sports training. According to this conception, training of a specific sports discipline must contain another large group of motor skill which do not form its contents but are important for reaching other aims of sports training. For example, they include gymnastic or athletic skills which are important for recovery, compensation and versatile development of an athlete. When you are engaging in sports and games, you need to know that failure isn’t the absence success, but it is merely a delay in success. of</p>
