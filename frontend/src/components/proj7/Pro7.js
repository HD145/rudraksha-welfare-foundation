                <p>We at RUDRAKSHA, are working under the Project Name “ANTEYASHTY SVAAMYAM” under the Project Head “HUMAN FUNERAL RIGHTS”, to assists in protecting the human rights with a motive of offering no cost last rite facilities of unclaimed bodies. Human rights are a set of rights which every human is entitled to. Every human being is inherited with these rights no matter what caste, creed, gender, the economic status they belong to. Human rights are very important for making sure that all humans get treated equally. They are in fact essential for a good standard of living in the world. Moreover, human rights safeguard the interests of the citizens of a country. Human Rights are essentially divided into two categories of civil and political rights, and social rights. Civil and Political rights are responsible for limiting the government’s authority that many affect any individual independence. Social rights of people guide the government to encourage ways to plan various ways which will help in improving the life quality of citizens. The power of the Universal Declaration is the power of ideas to change the world. It inspires us to continue working to ensure all people can gain freedom, equality and dignity. Human Rights are extremely important for overall development of a country and individuals on a personal level.</p>

Also, many families do not even have adequate financial position to live properly, and cannot afford the basic needs, and have a sudden death in their family. These families cannot afford even the prelamination of their beloved family member and due to this reason, these dead bodies get rotten. We will try to help these families, unclaimed bodies, and the ones who are alone, with a religious prelamination, with all the cultures and rituals and help them in gathering all the things which are needed. All the customs will be done in due diligence of priests, authorities from administration department, police, and family or relatives if any. We hope LORD MAHAKAAL will have mercy and make their souls rest in peace and allows us to perform the last duties of such unfortunate ones.</p>
